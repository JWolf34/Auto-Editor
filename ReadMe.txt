This code requires the use of the following non-standard libraries:
	- moviepy
	- mutagen.mp3
	
Run this code by executing "Editor.py". Doing so brings up a UI that will ask for a 
music file directory and a directory with video files. Choose which video files should 
be included in the edited video in the listbox, and select the "Edit" button to start
auto-editing the music video. Updates on the editing process will be given in a terminal window.
